# W215 Course Project Guidelines

You will design a research protocol to evaluate human behaviors or attitudes that impact security or privacy in computing systems, writing up the protocol as if it were an (incomplete) research paper and presentation. (Incomplete because you will not have time to run the study or get results.)

Pilot any components that can be piloted in the time available, and/or use peers from other project groups to identify ways to improve your protocol. Project groups will be either 2-3 people.

Be proactive about talking with the instructor before the project proposal is due in case you have chosen a topic that is out of scope or not well-scoped.

You may use the class’s running list of [<span class="underline">project ideas</span>](./ideas.md).

**You will want to get started early**, seek feedback early, pilot early, and leave time for many revisions of your study materials. In the words of a former student in this course after submitting a successful
project:

> *This is tough. Every time I take another pass at this I see more things I want to change. Are the studies you work on always this iterative? How do you know when you're actually ready to deploy?*

In fact, most studies designed by researchers with decades of experience will go through more iterations than you have time for during this term, often with over a dozen iterations of test materials and two to four pilot studies. One of the things you will be learning this term is that the human-subjects studies you read are the results of lots of work you are unlikely to read about in the paper, and far more work than most people understand.

As a course, we have a small budget of $100/student for running studies, so you can pay participants via such services as [<span class="underline">Qualtrics</span>](https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/) or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.



## Deliverables 

### Unit 6, before the live session

In the breakout group projects that we started during class 3 and presented in class 4, I hope you all learned that:

1.  > Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first step and worth your time. (Much confusion resulted when team members didn’t see the problem the same way.)

2.  > Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to very different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.) would best apply to the problem.

To motivate your research, please explain the possible impact of your research on your organization or on the broader world. What decisions might be better informed by the results of your study? For example:

* Is there a technology that you or others might choose to adopt or avoid based on the results of a study?
* Are you identifying pain points or challenges that will help you or your organization determine which problems still need to be addressed in a design?
* Will you be identifying users concerns so that you can better quantify them with a follow-up study so that they can be address down the road?
* Are there benefits to the study that cannot be expressed as decisions that might be changed or resources that might be alloated differently based on the possible outcomes?

**Please submit at least two paragraphs before the sync session**, and be prepared to answer questions about what you wrote. Send a link to your proposal to the slack group.

### Unit 8, before the live session

Submit a **one-page project proposal** (10% of course grade).

### Unit 10, before the live session

Submit a **revised proposal**.

### Unit 12, before the live session

Do a presentation of your **preliminary study design**.

### Unit 14, before the live session

Please submit the following:

1.  > Research materials needed to execute the study:
	* study/analysis plan
	* research protocols
	* any material required during the research activities (surveys, recruiting ads, etc.)
2.  > Designs, mockups, and prototypes at the appropriate level of fidelity.
3.  > Documentation of piloting the study protocol with at least two individuals (Groups of size \>=2).
4.  > A final paper giving an overview of the proposed study, what you hope to learn from it, and what you learned from the pilot study. It should have the following headers:
	* Motivation
	* Related work
	* Methodology: Ensure your discussion covers foreseeable risks section, with this example requirement *from UW’s IRB Application:*

		> Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, discomforts, and hazards to the subjects and others of the research procedures. For each harm, discomfort, or hazard:
		> * Describe the magnitude, probability, duration, and/or reversibility of the harm, discomfort, or hazard, AND
		> * Describe how the risks will be reduced or managed
		> Consider possible physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic harms, including possible negative effects on financial standing, employability, insurability, educational advancement or reputation.
5.  > Results section (forge some results assuming things go wrong)
6.  > A final project presentation covering a subset of the final paper.

### Unit 14, during the live session

Each group will share their project with the class. Be prepared to cover:

1.  > Which topic did you choose, and what are the research questions?
2.  > Which research method did you choose, and why?
3.  > What material did you prepare for the study?
4.  > What would be your recruiting plan and target demographics if you were to complete the research?
5.  > What were the results of the pilot sessions (at least 2 people) and how did the experience influence the research materials?

### Unit 14, two days after live session

Your group will submit a final paper describing your research plans and the results of the pilot. All necessary research materials should be included as an appendix. The report should be about 5-7 pages and should include:

- A summary of why the topic you chose is relevant and interesting in usable security and privacy
- A concise statement of your research questions and hypotheses, or what it is that you hope to learn
- A short summary of related work on the topic
- An overview of the research method, the prepared study materials, and any other information relevant to running the study or the design of the material
- A recruiting plan, including target demographics for participants
- A description of the pilot sessions (at least 2 people) and the resulting changes that were made to the research materials
