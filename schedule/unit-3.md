## Unit 3: Research Methods: Experimental

### Readings due

  - > Lazar et al., Chapter 3 Experimental Design

  - > Lazar et al., Chapter 10 Usability Testing

  - > [<span class="underline">The Emperor’s New Security Indicators: An Evaluation of Website Authentication and the Effect of Role Playing on Usability Studies</span>](http://commerce.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The%20Emperors_New_Security_Indicators.pdf), by Schechter et al.



### Assignments due

**Heuristic evaluation** (a method discussed in the async lecture for this unit): Perform a heuristic evaluation of a security feature in your web browser or on a website. You may do this either in pairs, or individually. You may find useful the classic article on [how to conduct an heuristic evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/), by Jakob Nielsen.

1. Choose a set of heuristics. You may pick some or all of [Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), or Shneiderman's 8 golden rules of interface design (described in Chapter 10 of Lazar's book).
1. Apply those heuristics to a security feature in an application or website, or to a feature that impacts security even though security is not its primary function.
1. Document your results using screenshots of the application or website you are analyzing; if possible, draw over the images to highlight those features that you (or any other evaluators) are focusing on when conducting the evaluation.
1. Provide suggestions on how any potential problems could be improved. *Your suggestion might be a new design, change to a feature, or it might be a suggestion for additional empirical research.*



### Synchronous discussion agenda

* Discuss answers to the assignment (15 minutes)
* Discuss paper (10 minutes) \[Cristian\]
* Split into breakout groups to discuss the following: \[Cristian\]
	
	> *“Imagine you are the head of engineering for a software company. Based on reports from customers, you are aware of some usability issues in the latest version of your product. How would you go about designing a study to determine how prevalent this problem is across your user base?”*

The class will be split into groups of 3 students, so that each group designs a study to examine one of the following products and associated usability issues:

1. *Phone lock screen software*: users complain about it taking too much time to login.

1. *Photo-sharing software*: users complain upon discovering that all of their photos are publicly-accessible.

1. *Application Programming Interface (API) for Cryptographic Operations*: a measurement study shows that most applications use the API incorrectly, resulting in insecure software built around the API.

1. *Secure messaging software*: users complain about not understanding how to verify that the people with whom they communicate via the software are the people they believe them to be. Some people have even reported cases of impersonation.

1. *Social media authentication*: users complain that they cannot log into their accounts when they have multiple devices.

Please be aware that descriptions above are (purposefully) incomplete; use the assigned sync time to attempt to define exactly what is the question you would like to have answered to improve your product, and how human subjects may help you answer that question. This discussion will be wrapped up during Unit 4, where you will read about research methods to complete your task.
